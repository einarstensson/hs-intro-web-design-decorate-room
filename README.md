You just moved into a brand new home and it's time to decorate!! That's always the best part. And then once you're all moved in, time to enjoy your new crib.

##Let's Get Started

We've set up the `click` functions for you, but your job is to fill in the rest.

You'll be coding your solution in `js/decorate.js`. You'll want to open up `index.html` in both the browser and the text editor. You shouldn't need to make any changes to `index.html` in order to code your solution. Don't worry about the code in `css/style.css`. All the styling has be written for you, and will work perfectly if you don't change the HTML.

**Step 1:** When a user clicks the button `Add Chair`, the `blue-chair.png` should appear on the screen. You'll need to use the `append` function to add the HTML to put the image on the page to the div with the class `chair`.

**Step 2:** When a user clicks the button `Add Couch`, the `couch.png` image should appear on the screen. Again, you'll want to use the `append` function to add the HTML for the image to the div with the class `couch`.

**Step 3:** When a user clicks the button `Add Chandelier`, the `chandelier.png` image should appear in the house. You'll need to use the `append` function to add the HTML to put the image on the page to the div with the class `chandelier`.

**Step 4:** When a user clicks the `Frame Art` button, a 5 pixel wide orange frame should go around the art on the wall. You'll want to use the `addClass` function to add the class `frame-art` to the image with the ID `art`.

**Step 5:** We all like to eat a lot of pizza. When a user clicks the `Eat Pizza` button, the box of pizza should disappear, and when the button is clicked again, the pizza should reappear. You'll want to use the `toggle` function on the image with the ID `pizza`.

**Step 6:**  When a user clicks the button `Add TV`, the `off-tv.png` image should appear in the house. You'll need to use the `append` function to add the HTML to put the image on the page to the div with the class `chandelier`.

**Step 6:**  When a user clicks the button `Watch TV`, the `tv.png` image should appear in the house instead of the `off-tv.png`. You'll need to use the `replaceWith` function on the image inside the `div` with the class `tv`to replace the images.

Done and done!
